    "article-main-paragraph": "We have prepared an amazing list with many accommodation options on Koh Phangan, Thailand. The hotels you will find in our group were selected with care, as we search for hotels for our vacation through deep searches, comparisons, and reviews across various channels. Hotels suitable for couples, honeymooners, families, and backpackers who love to relax and explore. If you are planning a perfect vacation in Thailand, whether it is a romantic getaway, a simple beachfront bungalow, a magical honeymoon, or a luxurious vacation, on Koh Phangan you will find a variety of options that suit your needs. Koh Phangan is a beautiful island in Thailand, located about half an hour from Koh Samui. With stunning tropical beaches, clear waters, and a relaxing atmosphere, itâ€™s somewhat like Sinai. The island offers a diverse experience for all types of travelers: couples, families, and backpackers. Everything from a relaxing beach vacation to various activities such as nature tours, snorkeling, diving, kitesurfing, wild parties, and rich local culture. You can also enjoy numerous and diverse workshops: yoga, meditation, Muay Thai boxing, Tibetan bowls, and tantra. Thong Sala is the largest commercial town on the island, with supermarkets, bars, and local markets, and is also where the pier is located. Ban Tai is close to the Full Moon parties and is recommended for kite surfing enthusiasts. Haad Rin in the south of the island is usually a calm town with an amazing beach. But once a month, during the Full Moon party, you will encounter thousands of tourists from all over the world, and hotels will require a minimum booking of 4 nights. The eastern side of the island, Thong Nai Pan, offers a stunning beach strip perfect for relaxing with luxurious hotels suitable for honeymoons, couples, and families. On the western side of the island, in areas like Wok Tum, Hin Kong, and Srithanu, you will find a variety of workshops, cafes, and restaurants, with diverse accommodation options ranging from simple to luxurious bungalows. Quiet beaches like Had Yao, Had Salad, and Chaloklum (the fishing village) offer a serene vacation experience with the ultimate Thai atmosphere.",
